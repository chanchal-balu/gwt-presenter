# Welcome #

Inspired by Ray Ryan's [Best Practices For Architecting Your GWT App](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/GoogleWebToolkitBestPractices.html) session at Google I/O 2009, this is an implementation of the 'Presenter' part of the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern discussed in the video.

You may also be interested in the [gwt-dispatch](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dispatch) library, which is an implementation of a 'command pattern' API for GWT.

Currently [GIN](http://code.google.com/p/google-gin/) helpers are bundled in, but they are optional - the API can be initialised directly or via any other DI or other scheme you wish.
