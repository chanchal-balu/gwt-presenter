# gwt-presenter
_Implementation of the Presenter section of a Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern._

# Welcome

Inspired by Ray Ryan's [Best Practices For Architecting Your GWT App](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/GoogleWebToolkitBestPractices.html) session at Google I/O 2009, this is an implementation of the 'Presenter' part of the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern discussed in the video.

You may also be interested in the [gwt-dispatch][https://github.com/randombits-org/gwt-dispatch] library, which is an implementation of a 'command pattern' API for GWT.
